<h2>About HTTP-NG</h2>

<P>HTTP-NG is an enhanced replacement for HTTP/1.0. It is
designed to correct the known performance problems in previous
versions of HTTP, and to provide extra support for commercial
transactions, including enhanced security and support for on-line
payment.

<h3>Why do we need a new protocol?</h3>

<P>HTTP is the fastest growing protocol on the internet. It is simple to
implement, and thousands of people use it every day to browse through
gigabytes of on-line hypertext. If HTTP is working so well, why
replace it? The driving forces behind this change are the twin needs
of performance and commerce.

<h3>The Need For Performance</h3>

<P>Part of the need for a new protocol is caused by the very fact of
HTTP's success. The original protocol was designed to be a simple way
of transferring a file between two machines. This led to several very
serious performance problems, adding extra delays to the time taken to
fetch pages, and preventing browsers from making efficient use of the
network.

<h3>Commercial Applications</h3>

<P>Although many publishers and companies are now starting to explore the
possibilities opened up by the World Wide Web, the protocols currently
in use do not support several very important features needed for
electronic commerce. Currently there is no reliable way to find out
the identity of someone trying to access a document. There is also no
way to convey information about charging and prices; nor is there a
way of dealing with on-line payment.

<h3>Can these changes be made by just tweaking HTTP 1.0?</h3>

<P>The major problem in making just minor changes HTTP 1.0 is that the
modifications which are needed change the fundamental model on which
the protocol is based. Each extension adds more and more complexity
to the protocol; as more and more enhancements are made, the problem
becomes much worse.  Since HTTP 1.0 is a simple protocol, it is much
simpler to recreate the existing functionality as part of a new
protocol than to attempt to kludge the new functionality into a
protocol not designed to handle such changes.

<h2>User Requirements</h2>

<P>Any new protocol needs to meet the needs to three different groups.
Individual users want to be able to browse the web without being
forced to wait for pages to be delivered. Information providers need
to be able to support large numbers of users, and to restrict access
to authorized users, and to get money from their paying customers.
Software developers need a system which is easy to implement, but
which can be optimized and enhanced to differentiate between products.

<h3>Simplicity</h3>

<P>HTTP-NG must allow simple implementations to be implemented simply 
without penalising more optimized systems. The protocol should be 
designed to work well for the commonest cases

<h3>Performance:</h3>

<P>HTTP-NG should allow objects to be transferred over wide
area networks efficiently.

<h3>Asynchronicity:</h3>

<P>HTTP-NG should allow a client or server to initiate a new         
request without waiting for previous requests to complete. It should
be possible to transfer multiple objects in parallel over a single
connection.

<h3>Security:</h3>

<P>HTTP-NG should support the transfer of encrypted  
objects. The protocol should not impose a single security policy or
mechanism.

<h3>Authentication:</h3>

<P>HTTP-NG should support mutual authentication between all   parties
involved in a transaction. It should be possible to      relay
authentication information through multiple untrusted   
intermediaries. It should also be possible to use multiple
authentication contexts over a single connection.

<h3>Charging:</h3>

<P>HTTP-NG should provide support for on-line payment schemes such as
<b>First Virtual</b> and <b>DigiCash</b>. The protocol should not impose a
single payment policy or mechanism.

<h3>Intermediate Servers:</h3>

<P>HTTP-NG should provide support for server to server       interaction to
allow for the maintenance of caches and mirrors,        and to allow
intermediate servers to relay usage information to      originating
sites.

<h3>Mandatory display:</h3>

<P>HTTP-NG should support the mandatory display of information       
relating to an object, such as licensing information, copyright,
authorship.

<h3>Logging Information</h3>

<P>HTTP-NG should support the transfer of logging information between
intermediate servers and the original source of a resource. Users
should be able to specify restrictions on the use of logging
information, and to discontinue transactions if such restrictions
cannot be satisfied.

<h3>Network requirements - Transports of Delight</h3>

<P>HTTP-NG is transport-layer independent, and can arrange for data
transfer using different transports.  However, since all uses of HTTP-NG
in the current internet will be over TCP, HTTP-NG must work well over
TCP.

<h3>TCP and the Internet</h3>

<P>Many performance problems in HTTP are a result of not taking Transport
layer interactions into account. Table 112 lists some important
points that need to be taken into account when designing a protocol.

<h3>Connection setup costs</h3>

<P>When TCP sets up a connection, it sends connection request to the
server, and waits for the connection to be accepted or rejected. This
adds a delay of one Round Trip Time.

<h3>Slow start limits transfer rates during start up.</h3>

<P>When a connection is first started, TCP initially sends only a small
amount of data. The amount of data that can be transmitted before
the sender must wait for a reply is increased until a steady state is
reached. If congestion occurs and packets are lost, the server slows
down the send rate until a new stable point is reached.

<P>Slow-start particularly affects the first request on a new connection.
If the request won't fit into a single segment, the client must wait an extra
Round Trip before it can finish sending the request.

<h3>Congestion information is not shared between connections</h3>

<P>Although slow-start is used to converge upon the correct transmission
rate for the path between two computers, this information is
not shared between different connections to the same host. Thus is
there are several connections running between a pair of hosts, if the
path becomes congested, the connections will interfere with each
other, leading to poor throughput.

<h3>Special purpose transport layers.</h3>

<P>As resource reservation and guaranteed bandwidth become more
commonplace, and as ATM moves into more general deployment, it becomes
important to be able to make use of special purpose transport layers
which are optimised for certain types of media, for example, a
multicast video transmission, or a ATM telephone channel. HTTP-NG should
be able to refer a user on to another service for actual data trans-
fer, whilst still being able to handle the relevant control
information.

<hr>
<h2>Protocol Model</h2>

<P>HTTP 1.0 works by creating a new transport connection for each
request. The client sends a request over the connection; the    server
replies over the same connection, sending information   about the
response, followed if possible by the requested data.

<P><IMG src="http-1.gif">

<P>HTTP-NG uses a different model. Instead of creating a separate
connection for each request, HTTP-NG creates a single connection
which can be used for many different requests. The connection is
divided up into a number of virtual sessions. One of these
sessions is used to carry control information - requests from the
client, and meta-data from the server. The other channels are   used
to carry the requested objects.

<p><IMG src="http-ng.gif">

<h2>Requests and Responses</h2>

<P>Each request and response is sent as an HTTP-NG message. Some parts of a
message are the same in all cases. For example, each message may need
to be signed by the sender to make sure that the request is genuine.
Other parts of the message are different for each operation. A GET
request will specify a list of the objects to fetch the response will
contain information describing the retrieved objects.

<P>All of this information must be encoded in some way before it can be
sent over the network. HTTP 1.0 uses a text based syntax to encode
requests, and a modified form of MIME to handle responses. This textural
representation is easy for humans to understand, but quickly
becomes extremely complicated when used to handle requests with
complicated structure.

<P>To avoid this complexity, HTTP-NG uses a different way of describing and
encoding the request message.  The scheme used is a simplified form of
ASN.1 and PER (Abstract Syntax Notation, and Packed Encoding Rules).
This scheme allows efficient, compact parsers to be generated
automatically, whilst remaining simple enough to allow hand-crafted
parsers to be built easily.

<P>HTTP-NG messages can be sent at any time. In the typical case, the
client sends a request message to the server, and gets back one or
more responses in return. The client doesn't have to wait for a
response to one request before sending out another. Since returned
objects can be interleaved on a stream, this allows clients such as
Mosaic Communications NetScapeTM to request objects as soon as they
discover they are needed, and allows intermediate servers to handle
requests from different clients to the same server in a fair and
efficient manner.

<P>Although the usual pattern is for the client to issue requests to the
server, there are some cases where this pattern needs to be reversed.
One example for this is the need to warn browsers if a requested
action would result in a hefty charge. In this case, the server needs
to be able to check to see if the client still wishes to perform that
action, and to discuss with the client how sir wishes to pay.

<h2>Negotiations - The Art of The Deal</h2>

<P>Because HTTP-NG doesn't restrict the types of objects which can be
requested, and does not impose a single security or payment policy,
there needs to be some way of negotiating which types and mechanisms
a client and server can support.

<P>HTTP 1.0 allowed clients to propose a list of types which they were
able to accept; unfortunately the mechanism used had several problems.
Because the client had to sent a list of all possible types with each
request, requests typically contained over 1K of type information.
This caused serious performance problem, and required a lot of effort
to process correctly. As a result of this complexity, very few servers
properly supported this type negotiation.

<P>HTTP-NG tries to simplify negotiation by adding an extra mechanism to
support the most common cases without affecting more complicated
situations. This new form of negotiation is based on the observation
that the vast majority of all WWW traffic involves the exchange of
just a few well-known object types.  HTTP-NG defines a small list of
these well-known types, and allows sets of these types to be encoded
in a short bitmap. A text only browser would sent a bitmap indicating
support for just HTML and plain text.  A graphical brower would claim
support for several graphics and sound formats. A server or browser
which only supports these types need only support this simple form of
negotiation.

<P>To indicate support for other types. HTTP-NG also allows the client and
server to add extra items to the bit-sets. The proposer send a message
containing the option being proposed (for example, text/ms-word),
together with a numeric code which will be used in later messages to
refer to the proposed value.

<P>This kind of indirect reference is useful, because it allows the
proposed types and values to become more structured without affecting
performance. This extra freedom can be used to support parameterized
types; for example, if a client is running on a 4-bit display, a
server can avoid generating a 24-bit deep image.

<P>The same method is used to indicate supported security schemes,
authentication information, and payment mechanisms.

<h2>Security</h2>

<P>Because there are so many different security schemes and policies,
HTTP-NG provides a general security framework into which the various
security components can be fitted. This results in several
architectural decisions. One such is the absence of any special
support for certificate exchange; this exchange is handled using the
Fetch request (which is after all the most fundamental operation in
HTTP-NG).

<P>The HTTP-NG message wrapper has fields which can carry arbitrary
authentication and security information. This allows each message to
be individually authenticated.

<P>HTTP-NG also allows an intermediate server to relay authorisation and
verification to and from another server on behalf of one of its
clients. This feature allows untrusted proxies to cache encrypted
data, and to relay the information needed to decrypt this data to the
end user without having to be able to decode the document itself.

<h2>Charging and Payment</h2>

<P>HTTP-NG allows a server to initiate a payment request in response to an
action of the client. This allows the server to request specific
authorisation from the client for actions for which charges will be
incurred. The challenge includes cost information, and a list of
acceptable payment mechanisms; the response may include payment using
a mutually acceptable method of on-line payment.

<P>The Client may also use the negotiation mechanisms to authorise a
series of payments without requiring explicit approval for each
item. The server can also provide pricing information as part of an
objects meta-data.

<h2>Mandatory Display</h2>

<P>The client may negotiate a set of fields such as licensing information
and authorisation which it is prepared to automatically display to
the user along with the actual requested information. This allows
information providers whose database licences require such
information to be displayed at the start of each session to be made
available over the web.

<h2>Copyright Control</h2>

<P>Each transferred object may have associated copying information
associated with it. This information can be used to assist honest
implementations from accidentally violating the terms of a licence
agreement.

<h1>Transition from HTTP 1.0</h1>

<P>HTTP-NG uses two strategies for transition from HTTP 1.0 to the new
protocol. One strategy uses a dual stack approach - the other is based
on the use of proxy servers.

<P>To support the dual stack approach, HTTP-NG has been designed to
co-exist with HTTP-NG on the same port. Each HTTP-NG connect begins with a
syntactically legal HTTP 1.0 request, using a non-existent method. If
an HTTP-NG client tries to talk to an old HTTP server, the HTTP server
will send back a `Method not supported' message; the client can then
cache this information, and repeat the request using the old protocol.
If an old server tries to access a new server, the server can either
handle the transaction using HTTP 1.0, or return an error message.

<P>The dual stack approach doesn't offer much improvement for clients
that don't support HTTP-NG directly. Proxy servers allow old clients to
take advantage of some of the newer performance features.  The proxy
server can pre-fetch inlined images using the new protocol, so that
they are ready and waiting when the client requests them; since the
proxy server will usually be on the same network as the client, this
reduces latency delays to a minimum.

<P>A proxy server can also multiplex several HTTP 1.0 requests over the
same connection. This allows browsers like NetScape to request
multiple concurrent images without causing congestion problems.
