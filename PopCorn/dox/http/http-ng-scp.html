<title>Session Control Protocol (SCP)</title>
<h1>Session Control Protocol (SCP)</h1>

<P>Several heavily used Internet applications such as
 FTP, GOPHER, and HTTP use a protocol model in which every transaction
requires a separate TCP connection. Since clients normally issue multiple
requests to the  same server, this model is quite inefficient, as it incurs
all the connection start up costs for every single request.

<P>SCP is a simple protocol which lets a server and client have multiple 
conversations over a single TCP connection. The protocol is designed to be
simple to implement, and is modelled after TCP.

<h2>Services</h2>

<P>SCP's main service is dialogue control. This service allows either end of
the connection to establish a virtual session over a single transport
connection. SCP also allows a sender to indicate message boundaries, and
allows a reciever to reject an incoming session.

<h2>Design goals</h2>

<dl>
         <dt> Unconfirmed service without negotiation. 

         <dd> SCP allows data to be sent with the session establishment; the 
          recepient does not confirm successful connection establishment, but 
          may reject unsuccessful attempts. This simplifies the design of the
          protocol, and removes the latency required for a confirmed operation.

        <dt> Low overhead

        <dd> SCP has a fixed overhead of 8 bytes per segment. This overhead is
         half the size of an IPNG address, and is only incurred once per 
         segment, instead of once per packet.

        <dt> Simple design

        <dd>The session protocol should be simple enough to implement for a 
         single application.

<h2>Protocol Operation</h2>


<h3>Session ID allocation</h3>

<p>Each session is allocated a session identifier. Session Identifiers below
1024 are reserved. Session IDs allocated by clients are  even; those allocated
by servers, odd. 

<h3>Session establishment</h3>

<P>A session is established by setting the SYN bit in the first message sent
on that channel. 

<h3>Graceful release</h3>

<P>A session is ended by sending a message with the FIN bit set. Each end of a
 connection may be closed independently.

<h3>Disgraceful release</h3>

<p>A session may be terminated by sending a message with the RST bit set. All
pending data for that session should be discarded

<h3>Message boundaries</h3>

<p>A message boundary is marked by sending a message with the PUSH bit set.
The boundary is set at the final octet in this message, including that octet.
