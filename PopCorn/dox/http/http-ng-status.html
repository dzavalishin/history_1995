<h1>Progress on HTTP-NG</h1>

<P>Here's some quick notes on how HTTP-NG is coming along - We've now got
a simple proof-of-concept implementation up and running, using a
minimalist set of requests and responses, and the results have been
quite encouraging. Even though the network connection between Bristol
and Civillization was extremely congested, initial timings seemed to
show that HTTP-NG was capable of using the entire path bandwidth
available when multiple requests were used. Initial measurements
seemed to show that for typical inlined-objects, HTTP 1.0 would only
use around a 10th of the available bandwidth, and that parallel
fetches degraded badly under congested conditions.

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<P>HTTP-NG is designed to be a replacement for HTTP 1.0 offering much
higher performance and adding some extra features needed for use in
commercial applications. The protocol is designed to make it easy to
implement the basic functionality needed for a simple browser whilst
making the addition of more powerful features such as security and
authentication much simpler than it is for HTTP.

<P>HTTP-NG uses a different basic model to HTTP. HTTP sets up a new
connection for every request, which causes a lot of severe performance
problems both in the time taken for each transaction, and the load
placed on both networks and servers.

<P>To avoid these problems, HTTP-NG allows many different requests to be
sent over a single connection. These requests are asynchronous -
there's no need for the client to wait for a response before sending
out a different request. The server can also respond to requests in
any order it sees fit - it can even interweave the data from multiple
objects, allowing several images to be transferred in "parallel".

<P>To make these multiple data streams easy to work with, HTTP-NG sends
all it's messages and data using a "session layer". This divides the
connection up into lots of different channels. HTTP-NG sends all
control messages (GET requests, meta-information etc) over a control
channel. Each object is returned over in its own channel.

<P>This separation of data and control information also makes redirection
much more powerful - for example, if the object is a video the server
can return the meta-information over the same connection, together
with a URL pointing to a dedicated video transfer protocol that will
fetch the data for the relevant object.  This becomes much more
important when working with multimedia aware networking technologies,
such as ATM or RSVP.

<h2>Implementation Experience</h2>

<P>There are several obvious ways of implementing HTTP-NG. The first
approach is to use a simple synchronous RPC model. The client
establishes a connection to the server, then sends out a request. The
client then waits until it has received all the data corresponding to
the request, then returns. This approach is very simple to implement,
and corresponds quite closely to current practice in older HTTP
clients. As a simple optimization, the implementation could send a
number of requests before waiting for all their responses.

<P>The second approach is to use an event based model. A simple
dispatcher can be wrapped around the connection. Each request then
adds a callback that should be called whenever the response to the
request comes in. This model works well with event based browsers such
as Arena and Netscape; it is also quite simple to implement.

<P>The final approach is to use a multi-threaded implementation; each
request and channel gets allocated its own thread, allowing multiple
requests to be processed in parallel.  This model works supremely well
for servers, especially those serving as proxies.  The proxy server
can keep a cache of open connections to other proxies or to popular
sites. Since each connection resides within a single process, requests
that can't be satisfied from the local cache can easily be switched to
the appropriate connection. This approach also allows efficient
gatewaying of HTTP 1.0 requests (see next section).


</h2>Transition</h2>

<P>The best transition strategy for moving from HTTP 1.0 to HTTP-NG is
through the use of intermediate proxy servers. This allows the
existing base of servers and clients to continues operating as they
are now, whilst still taking advantage of much of the performance
enhancements in the new protocol.

<P>The reason that this works is that most of the performance problems in
HTTP 1.0 are caused by delays in the network. If proxy servers are
placed close to older clients and servers, then these delays become
significant. For example, if two servers are placed at either end of a
transatlantic link, communicating with each other using HTTP-NG, but
accepting and sending requests to and from other systems using HTTP
1.0, all the HTTP 1.0 delays would all occur within a continent,
rather than spanning the intercontinental links. Further, a cacheing
server can interpret HTML documents and pre-fetch any inlined objects
before an HTTP client requests them.
