<h2>Introduction</h2>                                                           
Some POP3 servers and clients support non-standard POP3 protocol                
commands.  One such command is the XTND XMIT Berkeley extension                 
to send mail.  The following description for the XTND XMIT command              
is written in the style of the RFC defining the POP3 protocol.

Discussion:                                                                     
    Usually mail to be sent is transmitted from the client to the SMTP          
    server.  If the POP3 client and server support the XTND XMIT                
    feature, the client can upload mail for delivery to the POP3 server         
    instead of the SMTP server.  As the client has already been                 
    authenticated by the POP3 server, some level of security is assured.        
    Further validation may take place during XTND XMIT processing.              
    After the mail has been validated, the POP3 server delivers the             
    mail to a message transfer agent for delivery.                              
                                                                                
    The XTND XMIT feature allows one message to be delivered at a time.         
    The message transmission follows the basic operation of a multi-line        
    response as documented in the POP3 protocol, including the method of        
    termination and byte-stuffing where required.  The XTND XMIT command        
    can be used repetitively to send multiple messages.
