3ASTRA service is  created to access databases on EARN/BITNET
4by the users of  the  academic community.The initial data is
5provided by  IBM  and consisted of  IBM  study  contracts in
6Europe and  United States.  ASTRA  service  allows  users to
7retrieve data  stored in ASTRA databases in  CNUCE,  Pisa as
8well as the data stored  anywhere on the network.  Users can
9retrieve the documents and the software  and reports related
0to  the  search  criteria  they define.  The  databases  are
1accessible by ASTRA with the same user interface.  Users can
2submit data to the system as well as retrieve data.

5If you have, at your site, a database and if you are willing
6to make this database available to all the network community
7please contact us. The language or the Database Management
8System of the database doesnt matter.
9
0  Network access and usage:
1ASTRA    database   is   accessible   by   EARN/BITNET   and
2non-EARN/BITNET users. For EARN/BITNET users user interfaces
3for IBM VM/CMS and DEC VAX/VMS  are developed.  Also a batch
4language format has been developed for non-EARN/BITNET users
5and users of different operating systems.
6
7To access the ASTRA  system  the EARN/BITNET  user must have
8the user  interface on his disk.  The user  interface can be
9obtained from ASTRADB@ICNUCEVM with the following commands:
0                GET ASTRA EXEC      * For IBM VM/CMS interface
1                GET ASTRA PAS       * For DEC VAX/VMS interface
2
3After the  fiels  are  received  and stored on the  disk the
4server is accessed by entering
5                ASTRA               * For IBM VM/CMS users
6                RUN ASTRA           * For DEC VAX/VMS users
7
8The  detailed information on the  system can be retrieved by
9getting the file ASTRA INFO from ASTRADB@ICNUCEVM.
0
1For  non-EARN/BITNET  users  and users  of  other  operating
2systems  a  batch  language is  developed.  Following  is an
3example of the batch language:
