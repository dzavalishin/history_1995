Hello to all ectophiles!

Just wanted to announce to those of you who don't know already that Jim 
(jmg@rocket.com, mostly a lurker here) and I have just bought a piece of 
Seattle (a very small piece, mind) with a house on it (a cute white house 
with blue trim and strawberries outside).

So we're moving.  Our new address (as of Saturday) for the records (and
the ectofile, woj): 

Neile Graham & Jim Gurley
906 NW 75th Street
Seattle, WA  98117
new phone #: 206-706-1061

The phone number even rhymes.  It even rhymes with the street address.

Everyone, update your address books!

Subject:      Heather Nova Biography
To: ecto@ns1.rutgers.edu

Hi everybody,

I just got a very interesting biography of Heather Nova from her manage-
ment in London. I thought I should share it with you.

Let me add in advance that this bio must have been written in 1993. The new
album will be out in October 1994, a tour will follow afterwards (Nov.?).
It is possible that Heather will play at the PopKomm in Cologne on August 18.

    Enjoy,

            Ilka = )


*****************************************************************************

Heather was born and grew up in Bermuda. Her father, absorbed by the
spirit of the Sixties, quit his job as an architect, invested his
savings in a two acre piece of land in the Bermuda Sound and set about
designing and building a basic family home and a boat.

Whether at sea or on the island, the family developed a self sufficient
life style, and aside from being taught by her parents, Heather also
picked up on their musical tastes, Neil Young, the Stones, Bob Dylan,
Velvet Underground, Van Morrison, et al.

At 19, Heather left Bermuda for Providence, Rhode Island to study film
and painting at art school. It was through the necessity to create
soundtracks for her filmwork that Heather began to become more and more
interested in music. Inspired by old favourites, as well as new influ-
ences like Patti Smith and Lou Reed, she began to explore songwriting.

It was music that brought Heather to England, with a demo tape of basic
songs, she managed to blag gigs at the Cafe De Piaf, the Borderline and
and the Camden Falcon. Heather was approached by various managers and
publishers, but ended up recording a single for Big Cat Records. The
release of the single coincided a week later with the demise of Rough
Trade.

A planned tour, supporting the Violent Femmes, still went ahead, which
led to a subsequent tour supporting Bob Mould a few months later. Per-
forming at venues including Manchester International, Glasgow Sub
Club, Newcastle Riverside, Leicester Princess Charlotte, these tours
provided Heather with invaluable experience.

With this in mind she returned to her South London home and started
working on her 8 track home recording set up. 14 tracks later, she
pestered a shortlist of producers, from Lenny Kaye to Tony Visconti
to Youth with her tape.

Heather decided to work with Youth, who encouraged her to release the
songs as they were, feeling that they did not need embellishing with
additional production, and offered to release them through his own
Butterfly Recordings.

The resulting record, entitled "Glowstars", was released in a limited
edition of 5,000 copies in the UK and France, whilst Heather prepared
to record her first album proper with Youth producing. In six weeks
all the records were gone and the critics on both sides of the Channel
were raving:

"a perfect antidote to rock's increasingly dreary lack of invention...
Glowstarrs is a spectacular debut from a mercurial new talent "
NME Review

"excellent... Recommendably ravishint." The Wire - the National Jazz
and avant garde bible!

"Patti, Kate, Sinead.... Heather" Show - the national French music
magazine

It was on the back of these reviews that Heather hurriedly put a tem-
porary band together to get out and do some live dates. Her voice and
her songs, on top of her stunning looks, brought total enthusiasm
from the audiences (even the ultra cynical NME, at only the third
show, gave a rave review).

She will be starting to record her first album proper, with Youth pro-
ducing, which will be due for a release in the New Year. In the mean-
time a 6 track mini album, recorded live at a recent London show,
will be released on October 18th (1993), with some UK dates to follow.
