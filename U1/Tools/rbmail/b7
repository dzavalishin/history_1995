* Reply to message in RU.OS.CMP

Hi,

Replying to a message of dont@answer.com to All:

FUCK.

 d> X-RealName: Tom Lowe

 d> Taking 5 minutes to read what follows could be one of the best
 d> decisions you have ever made.

 d> On August 21, 1995, I saw an article in an internet newsgroup telling
 d> me I could make $50,000 within a month for an investment of only $5.

 d> I thought it was a huge joke. I spoke to my attorney, friends and wife
 d> about it, and they all agreed it was some kind of scam. I can't stand
 d> scams, because usually someone gets burned, and I didn't want it to be
 d> me. After rejecting the idea at first, I realized all I had to lose
 d> was the $5 in my wallet, and not much else. So, needing more than just
 d> $5, I figured what the heck, and gave it a shot. 

 d> Two weeks later, I began recieving money in the mail!  I could not
 d> believe it! Soon, hundreds, and then thousands of dollars began to
 d> roll in. Within 4 weeks, I had recieved a total of $32,445! It came
 d> from everywhere in the world.

 d> If you follow the three steps below, there is no reason why the same
 d> shouldn't happen to you! This is a legitimate investment opportunity.
 d> You invest $5, and you recieve a return on your investment. So does
 d> the next investor. NOT ILLEGAL, NOT A CHAIN LETTER- PERFECTLY
 d> LEGITIMATE.

 d> If you are not interested, then don't participate, but please print
 d> this article and pass it on to someone who may be interested, so they
 d> can take advantage.

 d> The procedure is simple:
 d> 1) Write your name and address of 5 sheets of paper.  Below that, 
write
 d> the words, "Please add me to your mailing list." Fold $1 note or bank
 d> draft or money order in each piece of paper and mail them to the
 d> following 5 addresses.:

 d>         1. Greg Carrol, 3658 Maurice Ave. Ft. Worth, TX 76111 USA      
  
 d> 2. Mike Burek, 2007 Sunny Brook Drive, Austin TX 78723 USA         3.
 d> Joseph Foreman, 27 St. Georges Cres 3147 Ashburton, Vic.           
 d> Australia         4. Rick Berk, 17-7 Pondway, Manorville, NY 11949 USA 
       
 d> 5. Tom Lowe, P.O. Box 203 17080 Girona Spain

 d> 2) Now remove the top name from the list, and move the other four 
names
 d> up. In other words, #5 becomes #4 and so on. Put your name as the
 d> fifth one on the list. you can do this by simply retyping the article
 d> or reposting it to other newsgroups with the edited addresses. 

 d> 3) Post the article to at least 200 newsgroups. There are 17,000, so 
it
 d> shouldn't be hard to find that many.  

 d> You are now in the mail order investment business, and should start
 d> seeing returns within a week or two. Of course, the more newsgroups
 d> you post to, the greater your return will be. If you wish to remain
 d> anonymous, you may use a psuedonym, but make sure your address is
 d> correct. 

 d> Now, here is why the system works:

 d> -Of every 200 posts I made, I recieved 5 responses. Yes, only 5. You
 d> make $5 for every 200 posts with your name at #5.

 d> -Each person who sent you $1 now also makes 200 additional postings
 d> with your name at #4. ie. 1000 postings. On average therefore, 50
 d> people will send you $1 with your name at #4. $50. 

 d> -Your 50 new agents make 200 postings each with your name at #3 or
 d> 10,000 postings. Average return 500 people= $500. They make 200
 d> postings each with your name at #2=100,000 postings=5000 return at $1
 d> each=$5000. Finally, 5,000 people make 200 postings with your name at
 d> #1 and you get a return of $50,000 before your name drops off the
 d> list. AND THATS IF EVERYONE DOWN THE LINE MAKES 200 POSTINGS! Total
 d> income in one cycle= $55,000.

 d> From time to time, when you see your name no longer on the list, you
 d> take the latest posting that appears in the newsgroups, and send out
 d> another $5, and put your name at #5, and start posting again.
 d> Remember, 200 postings is only a guideline. the more you post, the
 d> greater the return. 

 d> Lets review why you should do this. THE ONLY COST IS $5, AND 5 STAMPS,
 d> AND 5 ENVELOPES.  Anyone can afford $5 for such an effortless
 d> investment with such SPECTACULAR RETURNS.

 d> Some people have said to me, "what happens if the scheme is played out
 d> and no one sends me any money?" Big Deal, so you lose $5-but what are
 d> the chances of that happening??

 d> There are millions of internet users, and millions of new net surfers
 d> every month. 

 d> Remember- read the instructions carefully, and play fairly. thats the
 d> only way this will work. Get a printout so you can refer back to this
 d> article easily. 

 d> Try to keep a list of everyone that send you money and alwys keep an
 d> eye on the postings to make sure everyone is playing fairly. You know
 d> where your name should be. 

 d> REMEMBER-HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY.
 d> ENJOY!!!

Subject: Invest $5


* Reply to message in RU.OS.CMP

Hi,

Replying to a message of dont@answer.com to All:

FUCK.

 d> X-RealName: Tom Lowe

 d> Taking 5 minutes to read what follows could be one of the best
 d> decisions you have ever made.

 d> On August 21, 1995, I saw an article in an internet newsgroup telling
 d> me I could make $50,000 within a month for an investment of only $5.

 d> I thought it was a huge joke. I spoke to my attorney, friends and wife
 d> about it, and they all agreed it was some kind of scam. I can't stand
 d> scams, because usually someone gets burned, and I didn't want it to be
 d> me. After rejecting the idea at first, I realized all I had to lose
 d> was the $5 in my wallet, and not much else. So, needing more than just
 d> $5, I figured what the heck, and gave it a shot. 

 d> Two weeks later, I began recieving money in the mail!  I could not
 d> believe it! Soon, hundreds, and then thousands of dollars began to
 d> roll in. Within 4 weeks, I had recieved a total of $32,445! It came
 d> from everywhere in the world.

 d> If you follow the three steps below, there is no reason why the same
 d> shouldn't happen to you! This is a legitimate investment opportunity.
 d> You invest $5, and you recieve a return on your investment. So does
 d> the next investor. NOT ILLEGAL, NOT A CHAIN LETTER- PERFECTLY
 d> LEGITIMATE.

 d> If you are not interested, then don't participate, but please print
 d> this article and pass it on to someone who may be interested, so they
 d> can take advantage.

 d> The procedure is simple:
 d> 1) Write your name and address of 5 sheets of paper.  Below that, 
write
 d> the words, "Please add me to your mailing list." Fold $1 note or bank
 d> draft or money order in each piece of paper and mail them to the
 d> following 5 addresses.:

 d>         1. Greg Carrol, 3658 Maurice Ave. Ft. Worth, TX 76111 USA      
  
 d> 2. Mike Burek, 2007 Sunny Brook Drive, Austin TX 78723 USA         3.
 d> Joseph Foreman, 27 St. Georges Cres 3147 Ashburton, Vic.           
 d> Australia         4. Rick Berk, 17-7 Pondway, Manorville, NY 11949 USA 
       
 d> 5. Tom Lowe, P.O. Box 203 17080 Girona Spain

 d> 2) Now remove the top name from the list, and move the other four 
names
 d> up. In other words, #5 becomes #4 and so on. Put your name as the
 d> fifth one on the list. you can do this by simply retyping the article
 d> or reposting it to other newsgroups with the edited addresses. 

 d> 3) Post the article to at least 200 newsgroups. There are 17,000, so 
it
 d> shouldn't be hard to find that many.  

 d> You are now in the mail order investment business, and should start
 d> seeing returns within a week or two. Of course, the more newsgroups
 d> you post to, the greater your return will be. If you wish to remain
 d> anonymous, you may use a psuedonym, but make sure your address is
 d> correct. 

 d> Now, here is why the system works:

 d> -Of every 200 posts I made, I recieved 5 responses. Yes, only 5. You
 d> make $5 for every 200 posts with your name at #5.

 d> -Each person who sent you $1 now also makes 200 additional postings
 d> with your name at #4. ie. 1000 postings. On average therefore, 50
 d> people will send you $1 with your name at #4. $50. 

 d> -Your 50 new agents make 200 postings each with your name at #3 or
 d> 10,000 postings. Average return 500 people= $500. They make 200
 d> postings each with your name at #2=100,000 postings=5000 return at $1
 d> each=$5000. Finally, 5,000 people make 200 postings with your name at
 d> #1 and you get a return of $50,000 before your name drops off the
 d> list. AND THATS IF EVERYONE DOWN THE LINE MAKES 200 POSTINGS! Total
 d> income in one cycle= $55,000.

 d> From time to time, when you see your name no longer on the list, you
 d> take the latest posting that appears in the newsgroups, and send out
 d> another $5, and put your name at #5, and start posting again.
 d> Remember, 200 postings is only a guideline. the more you post, the
 d> greater the return. 

 d> Lets review why you should do this. THE ONLY COST IS $5, AND 5 STAMPS,
 d> AND 5 ENVELOPES.  Anyone can afford $5 for such an effortless
 d> investment with such SPECTACULAR RETURNS.

 d> Some people have said to me, "what happens if the scheme is played out
 d> and no one sends me any money?" Big Deal, so you lose $5-but what are
 d> the chances of that happening??

 d> There are millions of internet users, and millions of new net surfers
 d> every month. 

 d> Remember- read the instructions carefully, and play fairly. thats the
 d> only way this will work. Get a printout so you can refer back to this
 d> article easily. 

 d> Try to keep a list of everyone that send you money and alwys keep an
 d> eye on the postings to make sure everyone is playing fairly. You know
 d> where your name should be. 

 d> REMEMBER-HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY.
 d> ENJOY!!!

Subject: are you there?

Hi!
This is Monday afternoon but by now you are probably asleep for the night.
This is the time when we still become very sleepy. Our jetlag diet worked OK
except for this sleepy period around 3-4 in the afternoon. Diana is still
having some problems in sleeping through the night but she didn't know about
the special jetlag program.
Tomorrow Lee leaves for Portland overnight and then on for 5 days in Chicago.
Over the weekend Diana and Vika and I are going to go whalewatching with our
daughter and her husband (the ones who live near Boston.)
It's raining again today and my garden begs for someone to care for it. It
must now wait until after I return from Portland on Wednesday. We'll be
spending the night tomorrow in Portland before Lee leaves for his trip.
Hope all's fine. I'm hoping that when I go online in a few minutes there will
be a message from you. If so, I'll add a note to this. Otherwise, I'll send
as is.
Hi to all. Much love, Mary

Subject: Becky,


Hello Becky!
Monday 6:30pm  9/16
We are finally in a town, Astrakahn, that has a working Email.  I have 
been so
concerned about not being able to "talk" with you.  I do hope things are 
going
reasonably well. We are really looking forward to being with you again and
catching up with all that has been happening.
We have done a lot more traveling than we expected. We left Phila 7:30pm 
Fri,
flew all night to London, off two hours later to Moscow.  Transferred 
airports
with a Russian travel agency, met Andy Bishop briefly at the train to pick 
up
another suitcase of materials and rode 24 hours in our own compartment to 
Penza.
 It was then Sun morning and we trekked around the town and park, slept in 
the
Johnson's living room and left the next noon for 18 hours to Volgograd and 
then
another train 6 hours later for 24 hours to Kieslavask where the retreat 
was. 
It was great fun being with people and the train compartments are nice for 
2 or
4 people.
Kieslavask was a beautiful town with parks. We walked about 8 miles one 
day to
a cable car and back.  Did a little shopping but nothing too significant 
other
than a sweater/coat I think will work in Quito. Let me know ASAP of more 
things
you've thought of that we should bring for you.We've had good meetings 
with
folks.  they are wonderful, diverse group.  The Johnsons have four active 
kids.
Their Dad is a real go-getter and they will start ministry this week. 
There are
2 single girls you would enjoy being around.  One is only 20 and fun.
We leave for the States this thurs...from here 6:30am to  Bishops for a 
little
time and out that night to London where we overnight. ..and home Fri night 
pm
because we gain time that direction.
I think a lot about getting set up in Quito.  It will be great and our 
life
style is so much easier than here and more things available ...it makes me 
feel
guilty. Well I better run.  Hope you got your autobiography done OK.  Is 
it
going OK with Chelsea?
Say Hi to the McManuses..We still need their daughters Email in order to 
try to
get in touch with her.  Her phone line DOES NOT WORK unless she is 
home...We
miss you. Dad sends his love too.
Love MOM Address here is..............
