þ 12 Apr 96

  û UU2Fido: ^AVia date convertor trapped on 'received' lines with
    incorrect syntax (no ';' before date string). Fixed.

  û Fido2UU: Error messages are sent from 'sysop', not from the magic

þ  8 Apr 96

  û Fido2UU: Fixed bug in date conversion: month was incorrect.

þ  1 Apr 96

    be exactly 128 bytes long and its name must be equal to the name of
    recode table as given in configs.

! U1 Builder: version number changed to 2.09g

þ  8 Mar 96

  û uu2fido: ^AVia lines order reversed, date/time parsing bug fixed.

    not parsable or not in user table.

  û uu2fido: Seriously rewritten, now using new base classes for FTN
    and RFC messages access. Virtually no limit imposed on the length
    of RFC-style headlines. Adding '^AVia' line. MailHideHL now really
    does its job.

  û fido2uu: Seriously rewritten, now using new base classes for FTN
    messages access. 'Reply-To' headline now generated.

! U1 Builder: version number changed to 1.99g


! U1 Builder: version number changed to 1.99f

þ 02 Aug 95

  û All: FTN domain matching is not too strict now. When comparing
    dotless domain with a domain, comtaining dot, latter one is
    treated as if it had only part preceding a dot. For example,
    domains 'fidonet' and 'fidonet.org' are considered equal, but
    'fidonet.org' is not equal to 'fidonet.ftn'.

! U1 Builder: version number changed to 1.99e

þ 30 Jul 95

  û All: Log file time represenation changed to 24 hours.

  û snews.exe: sometimes skipped over some letters in packets. Fixed.
    As a side effect snews is nearly twice as fast now! On my node
    1.99a did 2-2.5 messages a second and 1.99f does 4-5!

  û snews.exe: now can process wildcards too.

! U1 Builder: version number changed to 1.99d

þ 28 Jul 95

  û All: There was fatal error in fatal exit routine :) - fixed.
    Improved diagnostic printout - errno text printed now, if
    appropriate.

  û rnews.exe: -file option was not able to process wildcards. Fixed.

! U1 Builder: version number changed to 1.99c


! U1 Builder: version number changed to 1.99b

þ 02 Jul 95

  û GRemote.exe: recompiled with C/Set. Still has disabled parts but
    can reply to help requests, at least...

  û GRemote.exe: now command set of GRemote can be extended with 
    Rexx scripts! Name of Rexx program is given in Rexx.Gremote.Cmd
    setup parameter. See hooks documentation for details.

! U1 Builder: version number changed to 1.99a

þ 30 Jun 95

  û Snews.exe: messages to undefined areas was silently discarded. Now
    error message is generated. Kludges RFC-Message-Id, RFC-References, 
    RFC-Path, RFC-Distribution now recognized and converted
    to corresponding headlines.

  û Snews.exe: REPLYADDR and RFC-From are used to create From: headline,
    if possible.

  û Unbatch.exe: X-RFC-Message-ID changed to RFC-Message-ID to match 
    Eugene Crosser's ifmail way of headline tunnelling. All the
    headlines passing to FTN side get "RFC-" prefix added for the same
    purpose. X-FTN group now used to create FTN to/msgid/reply.

  û UU2Fido.exe: UUCP messages with Return-Receipt-To headline get RRQ
    attribute when converted to FTN format.

  û Unbatch.exe: New newsgroup/echo pair definition modifier 
    XPostGuard=Yes|No. When set to Yes, prevents crossposted newsarticles
    from passing to this echoarea.

  û All: New setup parameter NoFlagsKludge, turns off generation of
    ^AFLAGS in netmail at all. For use with brain-damaged software
    that can't tolerate this kludge. I _DO_NOT_ recommend to turn
    ^AFLAGS off!

  û Batch.exe: New setup parameter NewsGrade sets grade to send uucp
    job with when sending news via uux. Works with uupc/ext only.


þ 09 May 95 (1.98t)

  û Unbatch: Crashed on very long (>50 characters) newsgroups names.
    Fixed.

! U1 Builder: version number changed to 1.98t

þ 04 May 95 (1.98q)

  û Snews: Sometimes crashed on incorrect dates in packed messages.
    Now reports error and replaces incorrect date with current.

þ 01 May 95 (1.98k)

  û Fido2UU: Fixed bug in CC: processing

þ 12 Apr 95 (1.98k)

  û Dmitry Zavalishin: Happy Birthday To Me :).

þ 12 Apr 95 (1.98j)

  û Now using IBM C++ Set to compile gate, because of Borland's errors.

  û Immediate result of IBM's compiler: profiling of unbatch let me
    speed it up once again.

  û Fido2UU: would finish processing before all the mail available
    was gated. Now keeps it going until nothing can be found twice
    in a line.

  û Fido2UU: (long standing one) Used to send error messages to 
    posmaster's fido address with empty 'to' user name. Fixed!

þ 06 Apr 95 (1.98g)

  û unbatch, snews: removed limit on echo/newsgroup table cache size,
    now preloading it at once. This change improved unbatch performance
    up to 1.5-2.5 times it was before.

þ 07 Mar 95 (1.98g)

  û uu2fido: New modifier to userdefinition made: -filedir=path.
    Now you have per-user control of where file attaches for this 
    user are put to. (This proposal came from Fyodor Ustinov.)

þ 06 Mar 95 (1.98f)

  û rnews: Do not exit when unknown args are given. UUPC 1.12k uuxqt
    sometimes gives us some shit at a command line :(.

  û batch: New delivery mode added: viauux -snews, see feeds.u1 for
    explanation.


þ 24 Jan 95 (1.98f)

  û rnews: Found a cause of traps too. :) Fixed.


þ 17 Jan 95 (1.98e)

  û Unbatch: It was possible to get year number > 99, that caused
    packet structure to be broken. Now checking year number, and
    stripping most significant digits if it was > 99. (so 107 -> 07, etc).

  û Batch: There was error in CNewsFeed mode that caused batch to
    send articles with big newsgroups list back to node they came from.

  û Batch: Found a cause of traps. Fixed.


þ 10 Jan 95 (1.98d)

  û Unbatch: Bug with code table conversion in CnewsFeed fixed, now unbatch
    converts text to FIDO-side cpodetable before placing it in out news
    spool.

þ 20 Dec 94 (1.98c)

  û Unbatch: bug with REPLYTO fixed - username part was missing, making it
    unusable for message editors. X-RFC-Message-ID now generated.

þ  4 Dec 94 (1.98b)

  û UU2Fido: Config. keywords MailPassHL/MailHideHL/MailKillHL now can filter
    from_ headline too. To get rid of from_ just put following line:

        MailKillHL from_

    UU2Fido: Now can be used with real pipe at stdin. (Workaround with temp
    file used.) This means compatibility with UUPC 1.12 for OS/2!

þ  2 Dec 94 (1.98b)

  û Bug in echo list code fixed - sometimes U1 insisted that specific
    newsgroup/echo pair is not defined in echoes.u1, even if it is.


þ 15 Jul 94 (1.98a)

  û OS/2-only version derived from UU2 and called U1 (UU2/2 = U1;)


þ  6 May 94 (1.92c)

  û Snews: rewritten Message-ID/References headline generation to
    conform widely used conventions. Added X-FTN-To, X-FTN-MsgID
    and X-FTN-Reply headlines to carry original FTN info intact.
    This will improve compliance with Eugene Crosser's gate too.
    Organization keyword can be ommited from conf. file now, and
    contents of Organization headline will be taken from the
    fido message Origin, if it can be found.


þ 23 Apr 94 (1.91a)

  û New Setup.UU2 parameter: CnewsFeed. Makes UU2 to act as a simple 
    Cnews-type system - feed received cnews articles back to uucp.
    Additionally, batch.exe now is able to check outgoung article's
    path against destination host name or it's aliases, as stated in
    Feeds.UU2, to prevent dupe loops.

þ 02 May 93 (1.91a)

  û Obsolete setup parameter: FlagDir. New parameter: KickUUCPFlag
    gives the name of file to create when something was sent to UUCP
    side.

  û setup.uu2: AttachStem parameter gives first four letters for
    file-attaches, created by uu2fido.

  û Fixed a bug in ftn/domain mapper, that caused problems
    with parsing fido addresses with domains. Improved origin
    address scanning in snews.exe. Added new default action to
    fido->uucp address mapper in snews.exe - now it uses default
    gate domain to build 'from' address if no corresponding FTN
    found.


þ 04 May 93 (1.91a)

  û Fixed memory allocation bug in address convertor code, caused
    exceptions in unbatch/uu2fido.


þ 10 Apr 94 (1.90e)

  û Fixed bug that caused the following diagnostics without reason: 
    "Elc: EchoList cache unable to fit into the given memory limits!".

  û Fixed overlay problem with DOS executables, caused 'Divide error'
    diagnostics at startup.

  û To make full use of OS/2 2.x virtual memory, echolist cache size
    was set to 100Kb in OS/2 version. (10Kb in DOS version).


þ 2 Jan 94 (1.90b)

  û Unbatch: Bug, caused seen-by to vanish in some cases, fixed.
    Feature: if Origin keyword is not defined, origin line takes
    its text from UseNet Organization headline.

  û All: New RFC-based code table had no 0x8D replaced - fixed.



þ Before....

  The gate was initially written in 1991, the wery first version
  of code had version number 0.70, in late 1991 and 1992 it was 
  nearly totally rewritten and released as 1.0 in the begining of
  summer '91.
