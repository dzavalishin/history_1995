U1 can be used as sendmail-driven mailer.
Sendmail version 1.3.2 or later should be used.
Note though that Warp IAK sendmail has been designed to work with slip
only and senses state of the slip driver. So avoid using it if slip
is not the only way you communicating with outer world. For use with
LAN TCP/IP or any UUCP connections get yourself a copy of sendmail.exe
from the latest :link reftype=fn refid=ip_csd.IBM TCP/IP CSD:elink..
The following excerpt from
sendmail.cf shows how U1 mailer can be described to be called by sendmail.
:note.Flag -x is ignored by U1 and used just to overcome glitch in
sendmail program execution logic.

To use sendmail instead of usual rmail, which is called by U1 to deliver
uucp mail, use
