:h1 res=6.Hilights
:ul.
:li.Two address convertion schemes at once&colon. Traditional 
(Z&colon.N/F.P <&dash.&dash.> pP.fF.nN.zZ.domain) and userlist&dash.based one. 

:li.Optional access restriction&colon. You can define domains which are accessible
for non-registered FIDOnet-side user. 

:li.News/echo gating in viamail/viauux/viarsh modes or via user-defined program. 
Compressed feeds supported. 

:li.Complete activity log, optionally with debugging info. 

:li.Statistics support&colon. all the letters passing gateway are logged together
with their origin and destination address, direction (to or from fidonet) 
and size. Just import this information to your DBMS and prepare any 
reports you like. 

:li.Remote access module&colon. broadcasts messages to all registered gate users&comma. 
sends help file on user request, etc. 

:li.Easy way to add specific headlines to your letters. Need 
'Return&dash.Receipt&dash.To&colon.' or 'Distribution&colon.' headline? Just write it in the 
first line of the message text - gate will move it into the header of 
resulting uucp message. 

:li.Cc, Return-Receipt supported. 

:li.Automatic UUencode of (small) attached files.

:li.Can be easily combined with nearly any UUCP clone. 

:li.Handy uucp address representation in Fido messages - in almost all the 
cases you don't need to add that stupid 'To&colon.' line to your message. 

:li.Advanced FIDO standards, such as FSC-0044, FSC-0035 are implemented. 

:li.Unlimited number of echo/newsgroups supported. There is no limit at 
all - adding more and more group names to list just slows conversion
down a bit.

:li.Optional Cyrillic code tables conversion. Additional code conversion
tables can be added to new versions of gate. 

:li.Large messages from UUCP to FIDO are PKZIPped and converted to  
file-attaches on the fly. 

:li.Filtering of control messages in UseNet news (such as cancel, newgroup...) 

:li.Selective headline elimination system&colon.
Define which headlines you want 
to see in FIDO messages. Definitions for netmail and echomail are 
separate. Unwanted headlines can be stripped or hidden under ^A. 

:li.Three log file formats - my own, BinkleyTerm and FrontDoor lookalike. 

:li.Powerfull log file filter&colon. all the messages are divided into classes. 
You can turn logging of each class of messages on or off separately. 

:li.Fidogate's 'Comment&dash.To&colon.' headline supported. 

:li.Ability to add 'Distribution' headline to all the messages in any newsgroup. 

:li.Well&comma. i'm tired to enumerate &colon.-)...
Just set it up and try yourself! 
:eul.
:p.
