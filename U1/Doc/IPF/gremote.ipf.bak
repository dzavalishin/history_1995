:h1 group=1 res=20.Remote control unit
:p.:i1.Gremote
This utility (GREMOTE.EXE), being started without any 
parameters, searches the letters which have been sent to the 
user with the name Gate and when found them, the utility
tries to find and execute the commands contained in letter.
It should be noted that the letters may come through Gate
too - gremote ignores the lines of the RFC822 letter header.
