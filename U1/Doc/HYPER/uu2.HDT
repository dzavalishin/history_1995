     1.1: It is a beta version!

          Hi, dear user!

     Well, this is another beta version of UU2. It has bugs, it 
does all but the things you need it to, it doesn't work at all... 
Sure, I do my best to make it better and better, but don't judge 
me too strictly, if something is wrong!


     1.2: Overview

     This product  (hereinafter  Gate)  is the  facility  that
enables you being  the user both  of UUCP  network (such  as
Relcom, UUNET,  etc.) and  FIDO (FidoNet,  LifNet, etc.)  to
integrate these networks. Gate is able to transfer  messages
from one network to another as well as integrate  electronic
conferences.

     2.1: Hardware


     No special hardware  required. Current  version of  UU2
will run on  any PC  compatible machine,  including PC  XT,
with 8086, V20 and  up to 486 processor.  I suppose it  will
work even on not "true-compatible"  machines, but if not  -
sorry, I had no such beast to test UU2 on.


     2.2: Software


     MS or PC-DOS 3.30 or later required. For those who runs
OS/2: native OS/2 2.1 version is partially complete, contact me
to get OS/2 executables.

     UU2 was tested (by myself or betatesters) with: MS DOS
5.0, OS/2 2.1 DOS box, Novell Netware 3.11, Lantastic,  QEMM
6.03 (stealth  mode), DesqView/X 1.0, FrontDoor 2.01-2.10,
BinkleyTerm 2.50-2.55 (and some sideway betas, such as  EE
beta D), D'Bridge, Imail 1.10-1.21, Squish 1.00-1.01,
TossScan (patched, see section  6.2.5 at page 18), Waffle
UUCP 1.64-1.65, UUPC/Extended 1.11, UUPC/* by Ache 2.0-5.0.
     In addition I must mention that UU2 was used in  multi-
channel FIDO systems in a  situation when gate modules  work
in both channels simultaneously.

 (Next chapter)

Two address convertion schemes at once: Traditional 
(Z:N/F.P <--> pP.fF.nN.zZ.domain) and userlist-based one.
See page 7



Optional access restriction: You can define domains which are accessible  
for non-registered FIDOnet-side user.
See page 7


News/echo gating in viamail/viauux/viarsh modes or via user-defined program.
Compressed feeds supported.



Complete activity log, optionally with debugging info.

Statistics support: all the letters passing gateway are logged together  
with their origin and destination address, direction (to or from fidonet) 
and size. Just import this information to your DBMS and prepare any
reports you like.



Remote access module: broadcasts messages to all registered gate users, 
sends help file on user request, etc.
See page 19


Easy way to add specific headlines to your letters. Need 
'Return-Receipt-To:' or 'Distribution:' headline? Just write it in the 
first line of the message text - gate will move it into the header of
resulting uucp message.
See page 20

Cc, Return-Receipt supported.
See page 20



Automatic UUencode of (small) attached files.                                          
See page 20



Can be easily combined with nearly any UUCP clone.

Handy uucp address representation in Fido messages - in almost all the 
cases you don't need to add that stupid 'To:' line to your message.
See page 20

Advanced FIDO standards, such as FSC-0044, FSC-0035 are implemented.
See page 24


Unlimited number of echo/newsgroups supported. There is no limit at 
all - adding more and more group names to list just slows conversion  
down a bit. Gate caches in memory up to 10Kb of group definitions.

Optional Cyrillic code tables conversion. Additional code conversion  
tables can be added to new versions of gate.

Large messages from UUCP to FIDO are PKZIPped and converted to    
file-attaches on the fly.

Filtering of control messages in UseNet news (such as cancel, newgroup...)

Selective headline elimination system: Define which headlines you want 
to see in FIDO messages. Definitions for netmail and echomail are 
separate. Unwanted headlines can be stripped or hidden under ^A.


Three log file formats - my own, BinkleyTerm and FrontDoor lookalike.

Powerfull log file filter: all the messages are divided into classes. 
You can turn logging of each class of messages on or off separately.

Fidogate's 'Comment-To:' headline supported.
See page 20

Ability to add 'Distribution' headline to all the messages in any newsgroup.

Well, i'm tired to  enumerate :)... Just set it up and try yourself!

     4.1: Mail transfer


     4.1.1  ... from FIDO to UUCP

This is what FIDO2UU.EXE is needed for. Being executed,
FIDO2UU.EXE performs the following steps:

     1. Searches NETMAIL folder of your FIDO system for
messages, that should be processed. Messages, that will be
processed by FIDO2UU.EXE must have destination address, that
is equal to the address, given in Address or NewsAddress
parameter of UU2 setup, and destination user name that is
equal to the name given in the Address parameter of  UU2
setup or contains character '@'.

     2. Each of the messages found is converted to UUCP-
style one as follows:

*  Origin address is searched in USERS.UU2 and replaced
with corresponding UUCP one, if found. If more than
one matching occurrence exists, first one is used. If
origin address is not found in USERS.UU2, user is
treated as not registered and some restrictions are
applied. (See below). In this case address is
converted to

     FirstName_LastName@pPOINT.fNODE.nNET.zZONE.<UU2_DOMAIN>

Where <UU2_DOMAIN> is a value of Domain parameter,
given in UU2 setup file.

* If FIDO destination username field contains '@', it's
value is used as UUCP destination address. Otherwise,
message is searched for the line of form: 'To:
<uucp_address>' and value of <uucp_address> is used
as destination.

* Message is searched for FIDO-style CC lines, all  of
those lines are converted to RFC-822 form and added
to resulting message header to inform recipient about
addresses where copies of letter was sent to.

*  Message is searched for UU2-specific XCC lines ('XCC:
<uucp_address>'). Uucp-addresses, that are given in
those lines are added to those listed in CC headlines
of resulting message, and copies of message are sent
to those addresses, as well, as to primary destination address.

*  Before sending message to destination or XCC address,
validity of addresses  is checked, if  user is not  a
registered one. Address assumed to be valid if all of
it's parts,  @exept  for  local name  (as  defined  in
RFC-822) are found among  the contents of Free  setup
file parameter.

*  Example:

   SETUP.UU2 contains:
       Free mycompany.com borland.com john.UUCP Frank


   Valid addresses:

       me@myhost.mycompany.com
       john.UUCP!JohnHimSelf@borland.com
       Hey@Frank%borland.com
       Frank!root

   Invalid addresses:

       john!root
       Somebody@borland.org

*  Message beginning is searched for all other lines  of
form 'Name: Value', and all of them are converted to
UUCP message headlines.


     4.1.2  ... from UUCP to FIDO

     UU2FIDO.EXE is responsible for it. Your UUCP package
must run this program instead of it's usual mail delivery
program (rmail or sendmail). To achieve that you need to
rename UU2FIDO.EXE to RMAIL.EXE or SENDMAIL.EXE, according
to what name mail delivery program has in your package. Make
sure you have not deleted original delivery program - gate
needs it to be able send mail to UUCP side.
     Another way to set up gate can be used if your UUCP is
able to call external delivery program to deliver mail to
specified domains. In this case you don't need to rename
anything at all - just set up your UUCP package to call
UU2FIDO.EXE. (For detailed discussion on this method please
see section 6.1.1 at page 13).


     4.1.3  Viamail news entry point

     If one of the delivery addresses is 'newsmaster' (this
name is configurable, of course), the letter will be sent to
the echo-mail too. For example, (if the configuration is the
same as it is in SETUP.UU2 file of documentation) execution
of the command "uu2fido dz newsmaster < news_article" will
lead to the sending of file contents to the user dz and,
what is more, to the conversion of file contents into echo-
packet in compliance with the contents of Newsgroups
headline. (In fact, UU2FIDO.EXE just stores the copy of
message in the UU2 inbound news spool. The conversion to
echo-packet is performed by UNBATCH.EXE)


     4.2: News transfer


     4.2.1  ... Echo-Mail to News

     This is a quite sophisticated process. Snews and batch
programs are responsible for it. To have the echo being
sent, your echo-processor has to make the packet with echo-
mail. The packet must be made for the  address placed in
NEWSADDRESS parameter of configuration file and it must not
be compressed by some compression program. In particular,
there is a possibility to create  non-compressed packets in
Imail 1.21 echo-processor. After starting with key -s,
SNEWS.EXE will search for the letters which have been sent
to NEWSADDRESS with echo-packet attached to them among
netmail and then snews program will try to convert and
delete the echo-packet. You may also attach snews to echo-
processor as an additional compression program. In such a
mode the program converts the packet and deletes it instead
of compressing it. Nevertheless, it does  not surprise the
echo-processor usually. The only trouble is that the
processor in this case generates the letter to which, as it
seems to him, the file is attached. You may clean these
letters by running SNEWS.EXE -s, but what is more likely,
the echo-processor will delete them in its next pass.
     The program SNEWS.EXE converts the letters of FIDO
format into UseNet format and places them in the special
directory, from whitch they may be taken by the program
BATCH.EXE later on. As a result of BATCH.EXE operation the
letters are converted into the news packets. In turn, the
packets are sent to the  receiving systems using method,
specified in configuration file (FEEDS.UU2) for that system.

     4.2.2  ... News to Echo

     The recieving of news also proceeds by two stages. On
the first stage, uu2fido (ViaMail) or rnews (@VaiUux) program
receives the news packet and places it into inbound spool-
directory. The program UU2FIDO.EXE considers as news
everything, that have been sent to the address, placed in
the configuration file in the parameter NEWSMASTER. The
contents of the spool-directory is handled by UNBATCH.EXE.
This program converts news to echo-packets addressed to your
node and places them in the your FIDO software inbound files
directory. Usually it is enough for your echo-processor to
find it there and to import.

     Ok, in general, installation of UU2 is not too
complex... for experienced FIDOnet sysop... who understands
UUCP technology as well :). Here's the common case described
step-by-step:

1.  Find (or create) good lovely directory to put all the junk to.

2.  Copy all the files there.

3.  Edit UU2 setup file.
    Here you will need to tell the gate which thing it
must call to send uucp mail (RmailEXE parameter). Usually  
it will be something like rmail.exe or sendmail.exe - refer 
to your UUCP package to find this out and...

 o 1st way: rename it! You'll have to replace original 
RMAIL.EXE (or whatever you have) with UU2FIDO.EXE. So:

    1.  Rename RMAIL.EXE to (say) UURMAIL.EXE

    2.  Rename UU2FIDO.EXE to RMAIL.EXE

    3.  In SETUP.UU2 set RmailEXE parameter to have value UURMAIL.EXE.

 o 2nd way: Make sure your UUCP package's RMAIL.EXE will 
call uu2fido to deliver letters to domain you're going to  
use for FIDO/FTN mail. Don't rename anything, in SETUP.UU2 
set RmailEXE parameter to have value RMAIL.EXE (or whatever 
it happens to be in your UUCP package).

4. Set UU2 environment variable in your AUTOEXEC file -
it must contain the name of directory you put UU2 setup files to.

5. Go to your echoprocessor setup and tell echoprocessor
that you've got a new compression program called UU2, and that 
it is known that to compress mail packet with that program 
echoprocessor must execute 'SNEWS.EXE name.pkt' or 
'SNEWS.EXE -i anything name.pkt'. You will use this 'compression' 
program to export echoes to gate. Assign it to the node or point
which address you have in NewsAddress setup parameter of UU2, 
than add that address to export list of any echo you wand to 
gate out.

   In the following subsections I'm describing 'interesting' 
details of UU2 installation together with a different 3-rd party 
software packages.

   If you can't find your beloved mailer, uucp package or packer here,  
please try to install UU2 without additional help :) and send me any 
information you want me to include in this chapter :).

         Waffle 1.65    UUPC/1.11 Extended    UUPC/* by Ache


   As it was said before, there's two differrent ways of UU2
installation exist - one with replacing RMAIL.EXE with
UU2FIDO.EXE, and one without such replacement.

     >>> Replacing rmail.exe

   Rename (Waffle's) RMAIL.EXE to UURMAIL.EXE, rename (UU2's)
UU2FIDO.EXE to RMAIL.EXE and put it to the directory where
RMAIL.EXE was, in SETUP.UU2 write:

          RmailEXE <correct_drive_&_dir>\uurmail.exe
          RmailExitL -1
          RmailExitR 0

     >>> Cooperating with RMAIL.EXE

Don't rename anything. In SETUP.UU2 write

          RmailEXE <correct_drive_&_dir>\rmail.exe
          RmailExitL -1
          RmailExitR 0

In <waffle_dir>\uucp\paths write:

          .fidonet.org                   | <UU2_dir>\uu2fido.exe
          <UU2_domain>                   | <UU2_dir>\uu2fido.exe


NB! Make sure you didn't set PassUnknownBack mode in UU2 setup!


     See also:

        Cooperation with Echo processors


     >>> Replacing rmail.exe

     Rename (uupc's) RMAIL.EXE to UURMAIL.EXE, rename (UU2's)
UU2FIDO.EXE to RMAIL.EXE and put it to the directory where
RMAIL.EXE was, in SETUP.UU2 write:

          RmailEXE <correct_drive_&_dir>\uurmail.exe
          RmailExitL -1
          RmailExitR 0


     >>> Cooperating with RMAIL.EXE

NB! The following method was not tested, I'm not sure it works.

Don't rename anything. In SETUP.UU2 write

          RmailEXE <correct_drive_&_dir>\rmail.exe
          RmailExitL -1
          RmailExitR 0

In <uupc_dir>\conf\hostpath write:

          .fidonet.org                   | <UU2_dir>\uupc2uu2.bat
          <UU2_domain>                   | <UU2_dir>\uupc2uu2.bat

In <UU2_dir>\uupc2uu2.bat write:

          <UU2_dir>\uu2fido %3@%2


NB! Make sure you didn't set PassUnknownBack mode in UU2 setup!

Versions supported:

     3.00 - completely

     4.07 - no viauux news reception possible

     5.00 - PassUnknownBack will not work well.

    Installation is nearly the same as for UUPC 1.11. The only
difference is the value of the following items in SETUP.UU2:

          RmailExitL          0
          RmailExitR          48

   In general, UU2 shouldn't be used with TossScan since TossScan 
strips off '@' character from FIDO message headers.

     7.1: Remote control unit


     This utility (GREMOTE.EXE), being started without any
parameters, searches the letters which have been sent to the
user with the name Gate and when found them, the utility
tries to find and execute the commands contained in letter.
It should be noted that the letters may come through Gate
too - gremote ignores the lines of the RFC822 letter header.

          Gremote understands the following commands:

     HELP          
Sends back a note concerning GREMOTE comands together with the 
contents of special file (See HELPFILE config. file option).

     USERS (Secure)
Sends the list of registered gate users.

     ECHOES
Sends the list of gated echo-, news-groups.

     NOTIFY (Secure)
Sends the letters to the all the registered users of 
gate with reminding, that they are gate users, what their address is and 
how they may ask for help.

     BROADCAST (Secure)
Distributes text following the comand (up to the end of the message)  
to the all the registered users.



     7.2: Statistics analyzer


Still in alpha testing, sorry.


The privileged commands may be executed only 
when a valid password is given. To use such 
commands you need to pass password in the 
Subject field of the letter.
Registered users are the users, which are 
mentioned in the USERS.UU2 configuration file.

     8.1: Sending letters via gate (FIDO side)


     8.1.1  Address

     Well, you going to send a letter to Internet. Recipient's 
address is "jack@jpc.super.org", gate you will use is placed  
at 1:333/22 and it's "magic name" is UUCP. (Gate's magic name  
can be set up in ADDRESS parameter of configuration file.) Two 
ways exist to prepare that letter.

    First method:

    FIDO destination address of letter must be "UUCP, 1:333/22", 
the very first line of letter text must be "To: jack@jpc.super.org".

    Second method:

    FIDO destination address  must be  "jack@jpc.super.org, 1:333/22". 
This method is much more convinient, but can be used only if Internet 
address is short enough to fit into the FIDO username field.


     8.1.2  Netmail reply

     When replying to letter, which came from gate, you always
have correct FIDO destination address, because UU2 makes FIDO 
letter "from" field to contain best kind of address possible, 
filling username subfield with Internet address if it is short 
enough, or with gate's magic name otherwise. In the latter case 
you need to type in "To: Internet_address" in the first line of 
your reply manually (Unless your message editor supports 
FTS-0034/35 recommendations). Note that Internet address of the  
person you replying to can be found in a special kludge line 
(REPLYTO) UU2 inserts.

     8.1.3  Receipt Request

     Letters with RRQ flag are confirmed with a fragment of
the gate log file, which corresponds to the processing of the 
letter. In addition, resulting uucp letter will carry
Return-Receipt-Request headline.

     8.1.4  Additional headlines

     In the very first lines of the letter you may insert the 
lines like "name: value". They must be started from the first 
position and must not have blanks between a keyword and a colon. 
It is desireable to make the first letters of the key words capital. 
All the lines of such a form (down to the first line not answering  
to this description) are considered to be the lines of RFC822-header 
of the letter and are placed there. Their width is limited by 75 
symbols.

          Example:
          |
          |To: myfriend@somewhere.us
          |To: news@kiae.su
          |Newsgroups: comp.lang.std.c++
          |Distribution: su
          |Return-Receipt-To: me@mydomain.su
          |
          |<- this is the left border of editor window :)

     8.1.5  CC feature

     To send a letter to the several addresses in uucp network you 
may use the following way: place at the very beginning of the letter   
the line 'xcc: address one_more_address ...'. Abbreviation 'xcc'  
(instead of the usual 'cc') is chosen so that the line would not be
interpreted by FIDO software.

     8.1.6  Text formatting

     Gate will automatically reformat the lines with the width more 
than 80 characters. Formatting is executed without right border 
indentation and hyphenation. Unfortunately, by now it is not possible  
to disable the formating despite of the fact, that sometimes I want 
to (to transfer wide table, for example). On the other hand, not every  
network may transfer the letters with the line's width more than 80
symbols, so gate in some sense provides @standartability to your 
letters.

     8.1.7  UUENCODE

     If you need to send a small file to Internet, you don't have to 
encode it yourself and stuff into the letter. Just attach file to the 
letter, and UU2 will uuencode it for you and send along with the text 
of letter. Please don't attach large files, 'cause  UU2 does not split  
'em up into the parts before encoding and resulting letter will be too 
large to pass through.


     8.2: Sending letters via gate (UUCP side)


     8.2.1  Comment-To

     When posting an article into the newsgroup which is gated to  
FIDO with UU2, you can force gate to set FIDO echomail message 'To'  
field to anything you want using a special "Comment-To:" headline. 
Syntax of that headline is "Comment-To: User Name <address>". User 
name given will replace the usual "To: All" in resulting echo message,  
and address is simply ignored.











     10.1: General


The FTSC assigned product code for UU2 is CC hexadecimal.

UU2 supports 3D/4D and partially 5D addresses.

UU2 creates and is able to receive Type 2+ packets, provided they 
have correct capability word as well as it's validation copy.

UU2 batcher doesn't add '#! cunbatch' line at the beginning of 
compressed UseNet batches. It is assumed that UU2 will be used  
with Cnews as the receiver of batches, which doesn't need 
'#! cunbatch' header.

Echo-News gateing: text, that follows origin line will be stripped.

Executable files are not compressed because of overlays contained in.

UU2 never gives up timeslices in multitasking environment since  
there's no situations when UU2 waits for some event to happen.

I did my best to make sure UU2 will not cause any problems on the 
network or under multitasker, but nothing is guaranteed. But if you  
encounter some problem related to file locking or something else
related to multitasking environment, please feel free to inform me.


     10.2: Standards supported


     UU2 supports FIDO standards FTS-0001, FTS-0004, FTS-0009,  
FSC-0035, FSC-0044, FSC-0053 and Internet standards RFC-822, 
RFC-1036, RFC-1123.


     10.3: FIDO kludge lines


          Kludge lines parsed:

FMPT, TOPT,  INTL,  FLAGS, DOMAIN,  MSGID,  REPLY, PID.

          Kludge lines created:

FMPT, TOPT,  DOMAIN,  INTL, FLAGS,  MSGID,  REPLY, REPLYADDR, 
REPLYTO, PID.

Please note that UU2 never attempts to find letter origin address 
in MSGID field.


     10.4: A word on errors handling


     In short, Gate registers errors in the protocol and makes
the following efforts to secure your property if it failed
to do something:

         -  Delivery error to UUCP

The letter will be generated to the sender of the initial message  
and to the postmaster. The letter contains the corresponded fragment  
of the UU2 log file and text of the original letter.

         -  The recipient was not found during delievery to FIDO

The original letter will be sent to the postmaster. If he is also not 
found in the users' list - so much the worse for you. The letter is 
simply lost.

         -  The news-group  has  not  found  in  the  list  while
            converting of news into echo

The letter will be sent to the echo named bad_group.

         -  The echo-group has not found while converting of echo
            into news

The letter will be ignored.

     Among the all fatal errors the worst ones are those, that may 
occure during delievery of the letter from UUCP. They, usually result 
in loss of the letter, because some of UUCP packages, when delivering 
received messages, simply ignore exit codes, returned by delivery program.
