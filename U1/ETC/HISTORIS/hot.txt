  û Unbatch: It was possible to get year number > 99, that caused
    packet structure to be broken. Now checking year number, and
    setting it to 17 if it was > 99.

  û Batch: There was error in CNewsFeed mode that caused batch to
    send articles with big newsgroups list back to node they came from.

  û Snews: rewritten Message-ID/References headline generation to
    conform widely used conventions. Added X-FTN-To, X-FTN-MsgID
    and X-FTN-Reply headlines to carry original FTN info intact.
    This will improve compliance with Eugene Crosser's gate too.
    Organization keyword can be ommited from conf. file now, and
    contents of Organization headline will be taken from the
    fido message Origin, if it can be found.
