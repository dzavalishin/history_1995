- Netmail gating, free mode or address table mode with limited
  access. Both can be combined.

- news/echo gating - viamail/viauux/viarsh modes, or via user-defined program.
  Compressed feeds supported.

- Statistics records in log file

- Remote access module: broadcasts messages to all registered
  gate users, sends help file on user request, etc.

- Easy way to add specific headlines to your letters. Need
  'Return-Receipt-To:' or 'Distribution:' line? Just write
  it in the first line of the message text - gate will move
  it to the header of resulting uucp message.

- Cc, Return-Receipt supported

- Automatic UUencode of attached files (FIDO-UUCP direction)

- Complete activity log, optionally with debugging

- Can be easily combined with nearly any UUCP clone

- Handy uucp address representation in Fido messages - in almost all
  the cases you need not add that stupid 'To:' line to your message!

- Advanced FIDO standards, such as FSC-0044, FSC-0035 are implemented.

- Unlimited number of echo/newsgroups supported.

- Optional Cyrillic code tables conversion. Additional code conversion
  tables can be added to new versions of gate.

- Large messages from Internet to FIDO are PKZIPped and converted to
  file-attaches on the fly.

- selective headlines elimination/hiding.

- Filtering of control messages in UseNet news (such as cancel, newgroup...)

- newsfeed: in addition to gateing news ro fido U1 is able to feed
  articles to other hosts via uux, mail, rsh (tcp/ip) or user-written
  program.

- Rexx!! Now you can alter the way U1 works with rexx scripts!

- Crosspost guard: stops crossposted messages (usually ads:-) from
  getting to the guarded echoes.

- Well, i'm tired to enumerate :)... set it up and try!
