The CopyFile function copies an existing file to a new file.

BOOL CopyFile(    
LPCTSTR  lpExistingFileName, // address of name of an existing file    
LPCTSTR  lpNewFileName,      // address of filename to copy to    
BOOL  bFailIfExists          // flag for operation if file exists 
  );

Parameters

lpExistingFileName
Points to a null-terminated string that specifies the name of an existing file. 

lpNewFileName
Points to a null-terminated string that specifies the name of the new file.

bFailIfExists

Specifies how this operation is to proceed if a file of the same 
name as that specified by lpNewFileName already exists. If this 
parameter is TRUE and the new file already exists, the function 
fails. If this parameter is FALSE and the new file already exists, 
the function overwrites the existing file and succeeds.

Return Value
If the function succeeds, the return value is TRUE.
If the function fails, the return value is FALSE. 
To get extended error information, call GetLastError.

Remarks

Security attributes for the existing file are not copied to the new file.
File attributes (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_*) for the existing file are copied to 
the new file. For example, if an existing file has the 
FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY file attribute, a copy created through a call to
CopyFile will also have the FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY file attribute. 
For further information on file attributes, see CreateFile.
