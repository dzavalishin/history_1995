@04 Jan 1996: Found & fixed huge memory hog in string class.
             Added code to move rips and unzip rizs from inbound
             without a special command file. Frip now changes directory
             to its home as well. Config file name can be set in
             'FRIP' environment variable. Inbound directory has
             to be specified in conf. file.
             Catching ^C & ^Break (at least in OS/2) & shutting down
             correctly.

09 Dec 1995: OS/2 and NT versions are using spawn() instead of system(),
             so that no limit is imposed on a length of a command line
             at all, even in Win95. Zip does its job in a single pass now.

09 Dec 1995: Writing date/time of frip start to log.

06 Dec 1995: Now added creation of map of routing - just storing processed
             rips in a tree of subdirs.

05 Dec 1995: CmdLimit parameter in conf. file. Default value for NT version
             is 100 bytes now due to Win95 limits (oh holy shit...).
             Optimized! Now up to 10 times faster when processing RIPs! :)
             Now flushing database to disk every 20 rips for safety reasons.
             Now debug output can be turned on/off from setup file.
             Fixed little bug in timing code: part of frip thought there are
             24 days in month and 24 months in a year :).

             Sometimes frip considered 'fidonet.org' to be not equal to
             'fidonet' because operator != was missed for class addr and
             compiler used string::operatot != with addr::operator string
             instead.

01 Dec 1995: Fix: Added -C flag to unzip.

28 Nov 1995: Fix: In DOS versions zip was used instead of pkzip.
             Now converting '/' to '\' in DOS mode before executing
             zip.
             Fix: Now stripping leaing and trailing spaces when parsing
             config. file.
             New setup parameter - Ansi [On|Off]
             NB: Now compiling with optimizer on.

26 Nov 1995: Fix: Log file now opened in append, not overwrite mode.
             Now zip command can be given as ZipCmd in config. file.

24 Nov 1995: New setup parameter - AnnouncePeriod.

22 Nov 1995: Fixed bug: now reannouncing if any .ad file changed.

20 Nov 1995: Added HOLD keyword.

16 Nov 1995: Bug fix in DeliverCommand code, TMail FAT/HPFS fileboxes
             support, obsolette route replacement. If DeliverCommand
             was commented out FRIP refused to update bink outbound
             and fileboxes. Now fixed.

15 Nov 1995: Alot of new frip.cfg parameters, Bink outbound support,
             HPFS outbound preliminary support, log file added,
             configurable deliver command line, route file line format,
             various fixes.

13 Nov 1995: Added new parameters to config. Fixed bug in temp. file
             name generator (sometimes it used to leave '?'-s in name),
             now before calling deliver converting filename to
             fullpath with '\' instead of '/' as directories delimiter.

11 Nov 1995: Error in deliv_at.cmd fixed.

10 Nov 1995: Error in address parser fixed.

10 Nov 1995: Compiled 16-bit DOS version. Don't use it, if possible!

10 Nov 1995: Announcer rewritten in C too and made automatic.

10 Nov 1995: Bug in address parser found: point number was ignored
             if no trailing domain was given.

 9 Nov 1995: Rewritten in C, except for announcer module.

29 Oct 1995: Now we automatically add all of our AKAs to outgoig
             rip seenbys, so that we'll never get it back to our
             other AKA, as it happened before.

29 Oct 1995: Bugfix: own rips (from announce) was processed
             incorrectly, generating crazy routes.


29 Oct 1995: More colours :)


29 Oct 1995: Speedup a bit: included text of fcanon into the frip.cmd

28 Oct 1995: Main config file (frip.cfg) added - now it holds
             addresses only. Used to prevent wildcard announces
             from destroying detailed routing inside of wildcard's
             area. Now you can safely let announe of, say, 2:5020/*
             come to any node in 2:5020 and not destroy it's roting.

28 Oct 1995: Colouring :)

28 Oct 1995: deliv_sq.cmd now keeps silence while works

28 Oct 1995: Now we put announces from ourselves into the base.
             This helps against receiving our announces back from
             other systems :).

 4 Oct 1995: When generating routing file, treat .0 as .*
