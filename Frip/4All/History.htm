<DT><H4>22 May 1997</H4>
<DD>Fatal timeout system temp. shut down due to OFFs storm made :(


<DT><H4>22 Mar 1997</H4>
<DD>Fixed bug in DOS/NT versions - CRLFs was killed in files sent :(
<P>
Database format changed. Converts automatically.

<DT><H4>16 Mar 1997</H4>
<DD>Rewritten msgid base header handling, now DOS/OS2/NT versions
are msgid-base format compatible. Base format version number
increased to force base rebuild.
<P>
Added dupe rif name handling: now received rif will not get
stuck because of rif with same name in 'routed' dir.


<DT><H4>12 Mar 1997</H4>
<DD>StatLog fixed, now works ok.


<DT><H4>11 Mar 1997</H4>
<DD>Now RIPs from future (more than 24 hours from now) are killed.


<DT><H4>05 Mar 1997</H4>
<DD>Frip off handler will never send back ads (rescans). There
was really nasty bug in off handler, which caused loop 
routing in some cases.
<P>
Fixed dos/win32 packer/sender bug - dead loop in file copy code.




<DT><H4>12 Feb 1997</H4>
<DD>Additional safe-checks added to .bsy code to make sure it 
will work ok even over NFS mounts without locking support.
<P>
Now ignoring hidden files in all searches by mask. (To honour T-Mail habits:)

<DT><H4>07 Feb 1997</H4>
<DD>Fixed bug with broadcasting off for our aka if our aka is
not listed in base for some reason.

<DT><H4>31 Jan 1997</H4>
<DD>New keyword (PackDirect) can be used to prevent packing of
direct netmail (polls, for example) with Frip. 
<P>
Bug fix: Frip will not pack freqs and update requests now.
<P>
Change: Now unpacking all the mail we have no route for.
<P>
Bug fix: changed the way Frip stores/loads database
to make it more fail-safe.


<DT><H4>21 Jan 1997</H4>
<DD>Added -NA flag to ads from .ad file. It makes sure the real
ad for this address will win anyway.

<DT><H4>19 Jan 1997</H4>
<DD>New feature: off-type rips are checked against dupe-base to 
prevent so-called off-storms. Such storms used to be when off
command is executed for address we have no routing at all
the nodes any more.

<DT><H4>07 Jan 1997</H4>
<DD>Bug fix: no rips would come from point to his boss due to
specific bug in seenby logic.
<P>
Added timestamps to path (via) marks. Now FRIP needs correct TZ to be set.

<DT><H4>02 Jan 1997</H4>
<DD>Bug fix: attempt to pack message with file attach, which does
not exist resulted in packing message once each start of FRIP.
<P>
New capability flag RIFRIZ meaning that this FRIP is able to
receive RIFs compressed into the RIZ file.
<P>
StatLog setup parameter lets user specify file where all the
passing fripmail will be logged.

<DT><H4>29 Dec 1996</H4>
<DD>Bug fix: mail to addresses, announced with .ad files, now
will be unpacked here too. In general, everything, directed to address
routed through our AKA will be unpacked.
<P>
Bug fix: now refusing to send mail, if routing for dest.
address points to our node.
<P>
Bug fix: DOS & NT version now change drive to one specified
in "dir" setup parameter at startup too.

<DT><H4>28 Dec 1996</H4>
<DD>PackFripMail setup parameter added. Now you can use different
netmail folders to send and receive frip mail.

<DT><H4>31 Jul 1996</H4>
<DD>Bug fix: frip off processing didn't send generated off-rips to links.
<P>
Frip netmail packer now recognizes kill/sent and fileattach attributes
and acts accordingly.
<P>
Frip netmail unpacker now clears
Sent, Received, Orphan, Local, Crash and Hold attribute bits
from message header.
<P>
Fixed bug in netmail packer - Frip marked outgoing netmail as
files, thus making problems for unpacker on other side.
<P>
Links state database now created and maintaied by frip. Ping time
average for last 10 pings is counted, last ping time noted, link
capabilities and state saved. Not used by frip yet, just built.
<P>


<DT><H4>29 Jul 1996</H4>
<DD>Basic netmail routing. Add FripMail parameter telling Frip the
             name of its netmail dir to use feature. Frip will try to send
             netmail from that dir if it knows routing for it, and puts
             received netmail there.
<P>

<DT><H4>25 Jul 1996</H4>
<DD> Written routing loss processing. If you are sure you have no
             correct routing for some node just type "frip off <node>", and
             frip will clean up routing info for that node and tell its 
             neighbours about that problem.
<P>

<DT><H4>22 Jul 1996</H4>
<DD> Received file path is saved to .HISTORY EA under OS/2.
<P>


<DT><H4>22 Jul 1996</H4>
<DD> Received file descriptions are saved to .SUBJECT EA in
             addition to FILES.BBS and DESCRIPT.ION files. Now OS/2
             users can observe file description via file settings
             (properties in Merlin) notebook, "file" page.
             <P>
BUG: descriptions are not read from that EA yet.
<P>

<DT><H4>22 Jul 1996</H4>
<DD> FARA is able to transfer file descriptions too.
<P>

<DT><H4>22 Jul 1996</H4>
<DD> FARA (Frip Aided Routing of Attaches) basically implemented :).
             Now you can say "frip send myfile.zip 777:9090/333@SuperNet"
             and frip will route file to destination without help of
             external packers & routers.
             Todo: small .rif files should be compressed into the
             .riz files.
<P>

<DT><H4>22 Jul 1996</H4>
<DD> AT LAST! Fixed interlocking. Now two frips will not work at once.
<P>

<DT><H4>27 Feb 1996</H4>
<DD> Bug fix: frip tried to process *.rip in inbound dir but
             was not able to because of error.
             Now processing rips just after any unzip of a .riz file
             to make sure pity FAT users will get better perofrmance.
<P>
             Bug fix: Now checking 'to' address of a rip to match one of our
             akas! That was a bad one... :(
<P>

<DT><H4>16 Jan 1996</H4>
<DD> Bug fix: database flags was lost on second run of frip. Fixed.
             Minor bugfix: now frip refuses to work if no config. file found.
             Now adding version name and current date/time to path lines.
             Added 'viaself' conf. parameter.
<P>

<DT><H4>15 Jan 1996</H4>
<DD> Added wildness filters for links. Fixed bug in UnzipCmd 
             processing - now inserting a space between command and args.
             Now we're able to set link weights by setting up time to add
             to incoming/outgoing rips - links.cfg parameter TIME+=.
             Fixed error in unknown rip fields bypass - newline 
             between unknown lines was missing.
<P>

<DT><H4>13 Jan 1996</H4>
<DD> Added simple int28 time release for DOS in semaphore wait mode.
             Ad approvement system written. Look ap-files.txt for details,
             but, sorry, there's russian only yet.
             New conf. keyword ProcessedFlag - file with this name will
             be created if possibility of routing change exist.
<P>

<DT><H4>10 Jan 1996</H4>
<DD> Fixed bug in b12 - filters was broken, now work again.
<P>

<DT><H4>04 Jan 1996</H4>
<DD> RIP types other than AD added, in idle mode. 
             Once a while a PING RIP sent to all our neighbours to let them
             measure link delay. No measuring done yet though.
<P>
             Database records now timed out taking in account RIP travel time
             so that routing will not switch to a very bad route
             even occasionally. 
<P>
             Now processing .ad files only if given permission in config, 
             and FRIP automatically advertises its akas without special tuning.
<P>
             Locking written - now two copies of frip will not run
             at the same time, one will wait for other to complete.
<P>

<DT><H4>04 Jan 1996</H4>
<DD> Found & fixed huge memory hog in string class.
<P>
             Added code to move rips and unzip rizs from inbound
             without a special command file. Frip now changes directory
             to its home as well. Config file name can be set in
             'FRIP' environment variable. Inbound directory has
             to be specified in conf. file.
<P>
             Catching ^C & ^Break (at least in OS/2) & shutting down
             correctly.
<P>

<DT><H4>09 Dec 1995</H4>
<DD> OS/2 and NT versions are using spawn() instead of system(),
             so that no limit is imposed on a length of a command line
             at all, even in Win95. Zip does its job in a single pass now.
<P>

<DT><H4>09 Dec 1995</H4>
<DD> Writing date/time of frip start to log.
<P>

<DT><H4>06 Dec 1995</H4>
<DD> Now added creation of map of routing - just storing processed
             rips in a tree of subdirs.
<P>

<DT><H4>05 Dec 1995</H4>
<DD> CmdLimit parameter in conf. file. Default value for NT version
             is 100 bytes now due to Win95 limits (oh holy shit...).
<P>
             Optimized! Now up to 10 times faster when processing RIPs! :)
<P>
             Now flushing database to disk every 20 rips for safety reasons.
<P>
             Now debug output can be turned on/off from setup file.
<P>
             Fixed little bug in timing code: part of frip thought there are
             24 days in month and 24 months in a year :).
<P>
             Sometimes frip considered 'fidonet.org' to be not equal to
             'fidonet' because operator != was missed for class addr and
             compiler used string::operatot != with addr::operator string
             instead.
<P>

<DT><H4>01 Dec 1995</H4>
<DD> Fix: Added -C flag to unzip.
<P>

<DT><H4>28 Nov 1995</H4>
<DD> Fix: In DOS versions zip was used instead of pkzip.
             Now converting '/' to '\' in DOS mode before executing zip.
<P>
             Fix: Now stripping leaing and trailing spaces when parsing
             config. file.
<P>
             New setup parameter - Ansi [On|Off]
<P>
             NB: Now compiling with optimizer on.
<P>

<DT><H4>26 Nov 1995</H4>
<DD> Fix: Log file now opened in append, not overwrite mode.
             Now zip command can be given as ZipCmd in config. file.
<P>

<DT><H4>24 Nov 1995</H4>
<DD> New setup parameter - AnnouncePeriod.
<P>

<DT><H4>22 Nov 1995</H4>
<DD> Fixed bug: now reannouncing if any .ad file changed.
<P>

<DT><H4>20 Nov 1995</H4>
<DD> Added HOLD keyword.
<P>

<DT><H4>16 Nov 1995</H4>
<DD> Bug fix in DeliverCommand code, TMail FAT/HPFS fileboxes
             support, obsolette route replacement. If DeliverCommand
             was commented out FRIP refused to update bink outbound
             and fileboxes. Now fixed.
<P>

<DT><H4>15 Nov 1995</H4>
<DD> Alot of new frip.cfg parameters, Bink outbound support,
             HPFS outbound preliminary support, log file added,
             configurable deliver command line, route file line format,
             various fixes.
<P>

<DT><H4>13 Nov 1995</H4>
<DD> Added new parameters to config. Fixed bug in temp. file
             name generator (sometimes it used to leave '?'-s in name),
             now before calling deliver converting filename to
             fullpath with '\' instead of '/' as directories delimiter.
<P>

<DT><H4>11 Nov 1995</H4>
<DD> Error in deliv_at.cmd fixed.
<P>

<DT><H4>10 Nov 1995</H4>
<DD> Error in address parser fixed.
<P>

<DT><H4>10 Nov 1995</H4>
<DD> Compiled 16-bit DOS version. Don't use it, if possible!
<P>

<DT><H4>10 Nov 1995</H4>
<DD> Announcer rewritten in C too and made automatic.
<P>

<DT><H4>10 Nov 1995</H4>
<DD> Bug in address parser found: point number was ignored
             if no trailing domain was given.
<P>

<DT><H4> 9 Nov 1995</H4>
<DD> Rewritten in C, except for announcer module.
<P>

<DT><H4>29 Oct 1995</H4>
<DD> Now we automatically add all of our AKAs to outgoig
             rip seenbys, so that we'll never get it back to our
             other AKA, as it happened before.
<P>

<DT><H4>29 Oct 1995</H4>
<DD> Bugfix: own rips (from announce) was processed
             incorrectly, generating crazy routes.
<P>


<DT><H4>29 Oct 1995</H4>
<DD> More colours :)
<P>


<DT><H4>29 Oct 1995</H4>
<DD> Speedup a bit: included text of fcanon into the frip.cmd
<P>

<DT><H4>28 Oct 1995</H4>
<DD> Main config file (frip.cfg) added - now it holds
             addresses only. Used to prevent wildcard announces
             from destroying detailed routing inside of wildcard's
             area. Now you can safely let announe of, say, 2:5020/*
             come to any node in 2:5020 and not destroy it's roting.
<P>

<DT><H4>28 Oct 1995</H4>
<DD> Colouring :)
<P>

<DT><H4>28 Oct 1995</H4>
<DD> deliv_sq.cmd now keeps silence while works
<P>

<DT><H4>28 Oct 1995</H4>
<DD> Now we put announces from ourselves into the base.
             This helps against receiving our announces back from
             other systems :).
<P>

<DT><H4> 4 Oct 1995</H4>
<DD> When generating routing file, treat .0 as .*
<P>

</DL>
