Description:

FRIP is a decentralized system, no central authority or control
required. Each one, who needs that, sets up FRIP for his system and
systems running FRIP start to exchange routing information packets
called 'rips' or 'ads' here. Each ad carries information about one
routing destination (either one node or complete network or even
zone or domain) and gives information about which node mail addressed
to that destination can be routed to. Each frip node once a while
creates ads describing himself and broadcasts them around. Directly
connected nodes receive this ad and send it along to their other links,
and ad goes on and on until it makes it to a node, which knows shorter
path to the given destination, that this ad came through.
